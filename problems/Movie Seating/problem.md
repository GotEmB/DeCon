Its weekend time and you have decided to go for a movie with your friends. One of your friends wants a seating arrangement where all the seats are either in one row or in one column. Since everyone has different seating preferences, he decides to develop a program that finds out how many seating arrangements are possible. However, he gets stuck during the debugging phase and that is when you jump in to help him.

### Source code file: MovieSeating.cpp

### Input
First line represents number of people going for the movie. Second line represents the no. of rows. N lines follow where each line corresponds to a row in the hall. Here N is the no. of rows and the representation of seats available is as follows:
The j-th character of the i-th element of the hall will be '#' if the seat at row i, column j is already taken and '.' if it is empty.

### Output
The number of seating arrangements possible.
