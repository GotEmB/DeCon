Emoticons are the new way of showing emotions to others. :D Some people use them to the extent that each and every sentence they type is followed by an emoticon  :P.  We’ll go a step higher than these people and code the whole program using emoticons >:-)
This program takes in one word and outputs that word followed by “:-P”

Any one word in English.

1st line is the word you inputted followed by
:P

#### Note
In this language, you just can’t run the entire program. You will need to type the first line and execute, type 2nd line and execute and so on(interpretive style).
