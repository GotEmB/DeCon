HTML is the markup language used for creating web pages on the World Wide Web. Any programming language(C in this case) can use this markup to create a dynamic page. 
This program aims to create a HTML table from input. We’ll take the runs scored by each batsman in some match to be as input. However, this program fails to do that. Can you find the bug?
Note that this program only has C specific errors. Knowledge in HTML is not required.

### Source code file: ipl.c

### Input
1st line is number of players. This is followed by name of player(one word), runs he scored and balls he faced in separate lines, for each player.

### Output
HTML output.

#### Note
Do not change any whitespace or new line in double quotes!
